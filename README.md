# Intergames Participation Tracking

This repository is hosted by the Head of Human Resources and Location Organizer in the event of Intergames 14. The team has envisioned to deliver an efficient and automatic methodology to track working hour of the participants. They also looks forward to implement this application in a further generation hopefully. 

## To run this application

In order to run this application, the user is required to install a Docker CLI (for the sake of easier deployment and development). 

1. Open a terminal and ```cd``` to the project root folder. 
2. Run ```docker-compose up``` to deploy the stack (this step would take a few minutes on a first run depending on your internet connection).
3. Try accessing the website in the browser with ```http://localhost:3000``` to check if the server successfully starts.
4. Finish setup the server.
